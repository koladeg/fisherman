# Project 1 | fisherman game

## Intro

A fishing games made with `canvas`, The  **fisherman** needs help catching some fish. You need to help him out.


The objective is to catch as many big fish as possible within 5 minutes. The player drops his hook into the lake with spacebar then moves the hook up and down to catch a fish. If the player touches the fish, the hook automatically returns the fish to the fisherman. The hook briefly rises up each time the player clicks on spacebar. If spacebar is not tapped, the hook falls to the bottom of the lake.
